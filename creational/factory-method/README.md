# Factory Method Design Pattern

## Overview
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern defines a method that should be used for creating objects instead of using a constructor directly.

## Key Characteristics
- Defines an interface for creating objects
- Lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- Defer instantiation to subclasses
- Encapsulates object creation logic

## Common Use Cases
1. **UI Components**: Creating different types of UI elements based on platform or theme
2. **Database Connections**: Creating different types of database connections (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. **Document Processing**: Creating different document types (PDF, Word, Text)
4. **Payment Processing**: Creating different payment method handlers
5. **Logging Systems**: Creating different types of loggers (File, Console, Network)
6. **Game Development**: Creating different types of game objects or characters

## Implementation Examples
This repository contains examples in multiple languages:
- Python: `python/app.py`
- JavaScript: `js/app.js`

## Benefits
- Encapsulates object creation logic
- Provides flexibility in object creation
- Follows the Open/Closed Principle
- Reduces coupling between creator and concrete products
- Makes code more maintainable and testable

## Drawbacks
- Can lead to a large number of subclasses
- May increase complexity for simple object creation
- Requires careful design to avoid violating the Single Responsibility Principle
- Can make the code harder to understand for developers new to the pattern

## Best Practices
1. Use when you don't know the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with
2. Consider using when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components
3. Use when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time
4. Consider using Abstract Factory pattern when you need to create families of related objects

## Example Structure
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        pass

    def some_operation(self):
        product = self.factory_method()
        return f"Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with {product.operation()}"

class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct1()

class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self):
        return ConcreteProduct2()
```

## When to Use
- When you don't know the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with
- When you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components
- When you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time
- When you need to create objects based on runtime conditions

## When Not to Use
- When the object creation is simple and straightforward
- When you know exactly what type of object you need at compile time
- When the application doesn't need to be extensible
- When you're dealing with a small number of object types that rarely change
